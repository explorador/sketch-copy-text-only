# Sketch - Copy Text Only

Just a boring sketch plugin to copy text from selected artboard(s) or layer(s). 🍻

## Installation

* Download the [latest release](/sketch-copy-text-only/releases)
* Un-zip
* Double-click the *sketch-copy-text-only.sketchplugin* file

### Version 2:

* Symbols support 👏
* Action messages: Now you'll know if your text was copied or something went wrong
* Cleaner code -> Easier to maintain 😃: Plugin was rewritten from zero
